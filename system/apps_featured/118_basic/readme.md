# BASIC interpreter

Following projects were analysed for fasibility of porting them onto LA104 platform:
- https://github.com/amigojapan/Arduino-Retro-Computer-with-SD-card-and-LCD-display-and-Keyboard-input-with-BASIC-interpreter/tree/master/BASIC_examples
- https://github.com/BleuLlama/TinyBasicPlus/
- https://github.com/robinhedwards/ArduinoBASIC
- https://github.com/trevorjay/atinybasic
- https://www.instructables.com/Arduino-Basic-PC-With-VGA-Output/
- https://github.com/terminal-basic-team/terminalbasic-arduino
- https://sourceforge.net/projects/terminal-basic/files/latest/download
- https://bitbucket.org/terminalbasicteam/terminalbasic/src/master/

Terminal basic was chosen because it seems most sophisticated, parially written in C++ with simple interface for integrating into LA104-OS
