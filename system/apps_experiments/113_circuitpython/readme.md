Circuitpython test
===============

Minimal platform independent port of circuitpython project executing simple in memory pre built code. Some fixes were applied to be able to run and debug on mac/pc. All changes are marked by "gabo" comment. Unfortunately still too big to fit 64kB ROM even with removing floats support and some other stuff.
