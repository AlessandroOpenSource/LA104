# DHT Sensor Tester

This app was created to read the DHT sensors data with ds213 using the ADC as "digital input". It should work with all type of dht sensors (not tested). Connect the Channel 1 and OUT to the data output pin of the sensor (pin 2) and provide a power supply 3V or 5V (in this case i used and arduino as power supply).
